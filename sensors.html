                <strong>Sensors</strong> are the devices which measure some physical energy (like
                tempurature or change in direction, etc.) and convert it into some 
                type of signals.
            </p>

            We all have access to sensors around us directly or indirectly.
             In your school building, smoke sensors are <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+mounted" target="_blank" class="mount">mounted</a>
             , which raise 
             and alarm the moment some smoke is detected. Today's smartphones 
             can sense the change in direction, your hands near the top, phone 
             near another device and so forth. All these are sensors around us.
        </p>
    
        <p class="secondPara">
            Sensors are used for measuring physical properties 
            or changes in them, such as tempurature,<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+resistance" target ="_blank" class="resist"> resistance</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+capacitance" target="_blank" class="capacity">capacitance</a>,

            Different types of sensors that are commonly used in various applications are:<br>
            <strong>Tempurature sensor</strong><em>(measure change in tempurature)</em>, <strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+proximity" target ="_blank" class="proxim">Proximity</a> Sensor</strong><em>
                (measures the proximity/position of an object relative to the screen of a device)</em>, <strong>Accelermeter</strong><em>
                (measures position, motion, tilt, shock, vibration and acceleration)</em>.<strong>Pressure Sensors</strong>, <em>(measure the
                    pressure or change in pressure)</em>, <strong>Light Sensors</strong><em>(measure the change in light intensity),</em>
            <strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+ultrasonic" target ="_blank" class="ultra">Ultrasonic</a> sensors</strong><em>(measure ultrasonic waves>,</em><strong>Smoke,Gas and alcohol sensors</strong><em>(measure 
            leakage of smoke, gas or alcohol),</em><strong>Touch Sensors</strong><em>(sense the position and pressure on a specific position of
            device),</em> <strong>Color Sensor</strong><em>(senses the change in color),</em><strong>Humidity Sensor</strong><em>(senses the 
                humidity changes),</em><strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+gyroscope" target ="_blank" class="gyro">Gyroscope</a> Sensor</strong><em>(senses the position, motion, tilt, shock, vbration and acceleration).

            <strong>Smart sensors</strong> are interlligent sensors that convert the measured quantities 
            into digital data, digitally process then, transmit them and can perform some ofrm of decision
            making.
        </p>
        <p class="lastPara">
            Sensors also play a very important role in Internet of Things(iot). The sensors of IoT are mainly 
            <strong> smart sensors</strong>. <em>Smart sensors</em> conver the real world quantity thet they're measuring 
            into a digital data dtream and are able to transmit them worelessly over a network. Te smart sensors have interlligent
            capabilites such as <em>wireless communication and being an onboard microcontroller. They are used for analog
            to digital conversion, digital processing, decision making and two way communications.
